# Enterprise-Network-Design-and-Configuration--Project
This project aims to design a secure and efficient enterprise network across multiple sites using Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2.2. It includes VLAN segmentation, dynamic routing, redundancy, and security measures to ensure scalability and reliability. The goal is to create a resilient infrastructure that supports seamless operations across all locations.
# Objectives
Establish a structured internal network with VLANs.
Implement dynamic routing using EIGRP.
Ensure network redundancy with spanning tree configurations.
Automate IP addressing using DHCP.
Secure the network with ACLs, encryption, and access control.
Simulate and test the network using Cisco Packet Tracer.
# Network Topology
Routers: 4 (configured for interconnectivity and dynamic routing)
Switches: 2 Distribution Switches (DSW) and 6 Access Switches (ASW)
End Devices: 4 PCs, 6 Servers
# Protocols and Technologies
VLANs: Network segmentation for efficiency and security.
EIGRP: Dynamic routing for optimal path selection.
STP: Preventing network loops.
DHCP: Automatic IP address allocation.
ACLs: Controlling traffic flow and security policies.
NTP: Synchronizing time across devices.
NAT: Network Address Translation for external connectivity.
PPP: Secure point-to-point connectivity.
# Suggested Hardware
Routers: Cisco ISR Series (e.g., Cisco ISR 4300)
Switches: Cisco Catalyst Series (e.g., Cisco Catalyst 2960/3650)
Servers: Dedicated DHCP and Log Servers
# Implementation Steps
Phase 1: Network Design & Implementation
Define network topology and segment using VLANs.
Assign VLANs to ports on Access Switches.
Configure trunking and EtherChannel using LACP.
Set up spanning tree priorities for redundancy.
Implement port security and BPDU protection.
Phase 2: Router Configuration
Configure sub-interfaces and assign IP addresses.
Implement EIGRP AS 1 for dynamic routing.
Set up DHCP for Sales and IT departments.
Configure NAT on the Cairo router for external access.
Set up default routes and advertise across the network.
Backup configurations to TFTP at the Cairo site.
Phase 3: Security & Services Configuration
Implement NTP for time synchronization.
Configure ACLs to control access based on department policies.
Set up PPP authentication for secure connections.
Enable logging to a centralized log server.
# Simulation Using Cisco Packet Tracer
Create a virtual network topology.
Configure and test VLANs, routing, and security policies.
Validate network connectivity and performance.
# Final Presentation & Documentation
Prepare a detailed report summarizing network design and implementation.
Develop a PowerPoint presentation covering key findings and configurations.
